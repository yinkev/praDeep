Allow developers to test UI components against different agent states, errors, and streaming patterns without running the backend.\n\n**Rationale:** Frontend development currently requires a running backend and triggering actual agent workflows to test UI states. Storybook with mocked agent responses would enable rapid UI iteration and visual regression testing independently of backend availability.",
