Store in React Context or state manager to instantly populate KB selection dropdowns when users navigate to solve/research agents.\n\n**Rationale:** KB selection is required for most agent workflows, but users often wait 200-500ms for the dropdown to load after opening solve/research pages. Prefetching this lightweight metadata (typically <10KB) during idle time eliminates perceived latency when starting workflows.",
