Enforce module boundaries using Python package visibility and create dependency rules that prevent cross-domain coupling.\n\n**Rationale:** Current flat 'src/agents/', 'src/services/', 'src/tools/' structure allows unrestricted imports leading to tangled dependencies. Domain boundaries would improve code organization, enable independent module evolution, facilitate team ownership, and make the system easier to understand.",
