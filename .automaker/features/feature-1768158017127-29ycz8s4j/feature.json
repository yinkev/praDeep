Consolidate the fragmented memory classes (InvestigateMemory, SolveMemory, CitationMemory) into a consistent state management pattern with transactional semantics.\n\n**Rationale:** Each agent currently implements its own state/memory management pattern, leading to inconsistent persistence logic and difficulty debugging state-related issues. A unified layer would improve maintainability and enable features like state rollback or replay.",
