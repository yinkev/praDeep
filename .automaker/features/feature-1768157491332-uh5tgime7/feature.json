Shows different strategies (e.g., algebraic vs. graphical, brute-force vs. optimized) with trade-off analysis.\n\n**Rationale:** Exposing multiple solution strategies teaches flexible thinking and problem-solving patterns. Students learn when to apply different approaches and understand there's often more than one valid path to an answer.",
