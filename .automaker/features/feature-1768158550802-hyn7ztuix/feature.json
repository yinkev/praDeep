  "description": "Implement file watcher for YAML prompt files that automatically reloads prompts when changed, bypassing the current cache. Add a debug endpoint to force prompt reload. This eliminates the need to restart the backend during prompt iteration.\n\n**Rationale:** Developers currently must restart the FastAPI server to test prompt changes, adding 10-30 seconds per iteration. With agents heavily relying on YAML prompts, this creates a major friction point during agent development and tuning.",
