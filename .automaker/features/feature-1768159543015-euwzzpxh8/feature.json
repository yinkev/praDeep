On subsequent page loads, render immediately from cache and revalidate in background, updating only if changed.\n\n**Rationale:** Provider configs are fetched on every settings page load and agent initialization but change infrequently. Caching eliminates 2-4 API roundtrips (100-300ms total) on each page transition, making agent startup feel instant. Background revalidation ensures users see updates within minutes.",
