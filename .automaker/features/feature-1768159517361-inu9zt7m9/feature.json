Create a WebSocketManager that dynamically imports and instantiates connection handlers (solve-ws-handler, research-ws-handler, etc.) on-demand rather than bundling all handlers upfront in api.ts.\n\n**Rationale:** WebSocket handlers for different agents have unique message parsing logic and state management. Since only one agent typically runs at a time, lazy-loading these handlers can reduce the main bundle by 15-20KB and eliminate unnecessary event listener registration, improving memory footprint.",
