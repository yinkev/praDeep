Define a Tool interface with metadata (name, description, schema, required permissions) and enable runtime tool addition/removal without code changes.\n\n**Rationale:** Tool usage is currently hard-coded in each agent's decision logic. A registry pattern would enable easier addition of new tools, better tool documentation generation, dynamic tool availability based on configuration, and simplified tool testing.",
