Include visual examples of how uploaded documents become searchable context for agents.\n\n**Rationale:** New users face a cold-start problem with no knowledge bases - they don't understand what to upload or how KBs power the RAG system. An interactive empty state with sample data reduces time-to-value and demonstrates the platform's core capability immediately.",
