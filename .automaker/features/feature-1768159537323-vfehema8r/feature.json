Set revalidation intervals (e.g., 3600s) to serve cached pages instantly while regenerating in the background when content changes.\n\n**Rationale:** Documentation and help pages are frequently accessed but rarely change. Serving them as pre-rendered static HTML eliminates server processing time, reducing TTFB from 200-400ms to <50ms. ISR ensures updates propagate without sacrificing performance.",
