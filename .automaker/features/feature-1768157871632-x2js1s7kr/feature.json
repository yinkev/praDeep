Include educational tooltips explaining why each step matters for RAG quality.\n\n**Rationale:** KB ingestion can take minutes for large documents, and the multi-stage pipeline (raw → parsed → embedded → indexed) is invisible to users. Progress visualization with educational content manages expectations and builds understanding of the RAG architecture.",
