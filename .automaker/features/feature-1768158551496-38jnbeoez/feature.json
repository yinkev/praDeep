Include options to override prompts, temperature, or tool calls for debugging.\n\n**Rationale:** Currently, testing agent changes requires running full workflows from scratch, wasting time and LLM tokens. Replay capabilities would let developers quickly iterate on specific agent logic without re-executing expensive earlier steps.",
