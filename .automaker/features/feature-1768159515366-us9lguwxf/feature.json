Each module has distinct UI components and dependencies that are rarely used together. Use dynamic imports with next/dynamic to load agent-specific components only when their routes are accessed.\n\n**Rationale:** With 7+ distinct agent workflows, users typically interact with one or two at a time. Route-based splitting can reduce initial bundle size by 60-70%, improving first contentful paint and time-to-interactive, especially for users on slower connections accessing the landing page or a single agent.",
