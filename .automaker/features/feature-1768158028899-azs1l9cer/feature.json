Include exponential backoff and health check recovery.\n\n**Rationale:** Current retry logic is scattered across services with inconsistent timeout handling. Circuit breakers would prevent cascading failures, reduce wasted resources on failing calls, improve system resilience, and provide better failure visibility through metrics.",
