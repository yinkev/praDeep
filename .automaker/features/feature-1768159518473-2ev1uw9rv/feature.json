  "description": "Wrap markdown rendering components (used for solve outputs, research reports, notebook displays) in React.memo. Cache parsed markdown AST using useMemo keyed on content hash. Since outputs are immersive and re-render frequently during streaming, memoization prevents redundant parsing of static sections.\n\n**Rationale:** Markdown parsing is CPU-intensive, especially for long solve outputs with citations and code blocks. During WebSocket streaming updates, unchanged sections re-render unnecessarily. Memoization can reduce rendering time by 40-60% for complex documents, maintaining 60fps during live updates.",
