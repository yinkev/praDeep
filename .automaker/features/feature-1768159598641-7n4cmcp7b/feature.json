  "description": "Add prefetching system that predicts next-stage resource needs in solve/research pipelines (e.g., preload citation memory when tool execution starts). Use task dependency graph to trigger parallel resource loading. Include warmup for frequently-used tools and models.\n\n**Rationale:** Multi-stage agents (MainSolver, ResearchPipeline) currently load resources sequentially as each stage starts. Intelligent prefetching based on workflow patterns can reduce stage transition latency by 30-50%, making workflows feel more responsive.",
