Use direct imports (import Button from '@/components/ui/button') instead of wildcard imports. Configure webpack/turbopack to tree-shake unused UI components across agent modules.\n\n**Rationale:** Barrel exports prevent tree-shaking because bundlers can't determine which components are actually used. With 7+ agent UIs sharing a component library, eliminating barrels can reduce bundle size by 25-40KB by removing unused variants of buttons, modals, forms, etc. that specific agents never render.",
