Refactor all direct file I/O operations in agents, KB management, and output persistence to use this interface.\n\n**Rationale:** Hard-coded filesystem paths throughout the codebase ('data/knowledge_bases/', 'data/user/') limit deployment flexibility and make testing difficult. An abstraction layer would enable cloud storage backends, easier testing with in-memory storage, and better scalability.",
