Automatically adjust tool selection strategy in SolveAgent based on question type patterns.\n\n**Rationale:** Current tool selection relies on static logic. Users can't easily optimize tool usage without code changes. Adaptive tool selection learns from outcomes to reduce unnecessary tool calls and improve efficiency.",
