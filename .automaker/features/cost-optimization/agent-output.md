I'll continue implementing the intelligent routing feature. Let me first check the current state of the codebase and what was previously explored.

🔧 Tool: mcp__plugin_episodic-memory_episodic-memory__search
Input: {
  "query": [
    "cost optimization",
    "intelligent routing",
    "LLM provider",
    "praDeep"
  ],
  "limit": 5
}

🔧 Tool: Glob
Input: {
  "pattern": "**/*.py"
}

🔧 Tool: Glob

  "pattern": "**/routing*.py"
}
Let me explore the key files to understand the LLM provider structure and base agent pattern:
