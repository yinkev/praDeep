Implement using a lightweight in-process event dispatcher with optional persistence for audit trails.\n\n**Rationale:** Current tight coupling between agents (e.g., MainSolver orchestrating Analysis/Solve loops) makes it difficult to modify agent behavior, add new agents, or test agents in isolation. Event-driven design would enable better separation of concerns and easier extension.",
