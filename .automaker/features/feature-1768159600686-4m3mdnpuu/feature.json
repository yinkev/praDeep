  "description": "Create memory-mapped shared storage for agent memories (InvestigateMemory, SolveMemory, citation data) using multiprocessing.shared_memory or Redis. Implement copy-on-write semantics for concurrent access. Add memory pressure monitoring with automatic eviction.\n\n**Rationale:** Each agent instance maintains isolated in-memory state that's serialized to JSON files. Shared memory reduces duplication across concurrent sessions, enables efficient state passing between agent stages, and can reduce memory usage by 40-60% under load.",
