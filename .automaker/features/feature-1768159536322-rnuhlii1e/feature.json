Configure automatic WebP/AVIF conversion, responsive srcsets, and blur-up placeholders. Lazy load images below the fold with loading='lazy' priority.\n\n**Rationale:** Solve and research outputs often contain 5-15 images from /api/outputs. Without optimization, images are served as-is (often large PNGs), causing layout shifts and slow loads. Next.js Image reduces bandwidth by 50-70% and provides instant placeholder feedback, improving perceived performance.",
