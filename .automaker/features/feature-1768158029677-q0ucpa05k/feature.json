Implement filesystem-based repositories initially, with clear migration path to database implementations.\n\n**Rationale:** Data access logic is currently mixed with business logic throughout agents and routers, making it difficult to migrate to PostgreSQL (mentioned in backlog) or test components independently. Repositories would enable clean separation and easier persistence layer swapping.",
