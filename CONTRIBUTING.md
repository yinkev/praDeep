## ⚠️ Contribution Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **All contributions must be based on the `dev` branch!**
>
> 1. Fork the repository and clone it locally
> 2. **Always pull from the `dev` branch**: `git checkout dev && git pull origin dev`
> 3. Create your feature branch from `dev`: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
> 4. Submit your PR to the `dev` branch (NOT `main`)
> 5. Ensure all pre-commit checks pass before submitting

## 🛠️ Code Quality

We use automated tools to maintain code quality:

- **Ruff** — Python linting & formatting (`pyproject.toml`)
- **Prettier** — Frontend formatting (`web/.prettierrc.json`)
- **detect-secrets** — Security scanning

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Before submitting a PR, you MUST run:** `pre-commit run --all-files`
>
> CI will automatically check this and **reject PRs** that fail pre-commit checks.

<details>
<summary><b>Setting Up Pre-commit (First Time Only)</b></summary>

**Step 1: Install pre-commit**
```bash
# Using pip
pip install pre-commit

# Or using conda
conda install -c conda-forge pre-commit
```

**Step 2: Install Git hooks (recommended)**
```bash
cd praDeep
pre-commit install
```
> After this, hooks will run **automatically** on every commit — no need to remember!

**Step 3: Run checks on all files**
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

</details>

### Common Commands

```bash
# Normal commit (hooks run automatically if installed)
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Manually check all files (do this before pushing!)
pre-commit run --all-files

# Update hooks to latest versions
pre-commit autoupdate

# Skip hooks (not recommended, only for emergencies)
git commit --no-verify -m "Emergency fix"
```

## 📋 Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```
**Types**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

**Examples**:
- `feat: for a new feature. This typically corresponds to a MINOR version bump in Semantic Versioning.`
- `fix: for a bug fix. This typically corresponds to a PATCH version bump.`
- `chore: for routine tasks that do not modify source code or tests (e.g., updating build processes).`
- `docs: for documentation-only changes.`
- `style: for changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (e.g., whitespace, semicolons).`
- `refactor: for code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.`
- `test: for adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.`
